This project explores deep learning techniques for image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset. The main goal was to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and experiment with different optimizers, learning rates, and hyperparameters to analyze their effect on model performance.


Implemented CNNs from scratch using PyTorch

Conducted experiments with multiple optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSprop, AdamW

Tested the impact of different learning rates and batch sizes

Compared training and validation accuracy across configurations

Visualized model performance and training dynamics

Results:

Demonstrated how optimizer choice and hyperparameters significantly affect training convergence and accuracy

Improved baseline CNN performance through systematic experimentation

Gained deeper insights into optimization strategies for deep learning models
